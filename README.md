# brandr

This was a project for me to try and improve upon arandr as its hasn't been updated in a decade if I am correct.  

Currently the app just enabled you to move monitors around, disable/enable them, and set resolution.

It has the feature of being able to actually see whats on the monitor you are moving by taking screenshots of the screen and mapping them correctly.  

It manages displays similar to arandr where its just using xrandr on the backend so you need to be using X11

### To Do  
Some of the things I didn't get to include were   
 - More display preferences right now its the bare minumum   
 - Ability to save display setups like arandr   
 - Snaping to each monitor like arandr    
 - Position feedback to the user to know if unaligned    
 - Resizing of the whole gui   
 - Detection when monitors change with udev rules to prompt the user
